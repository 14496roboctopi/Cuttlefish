# Module Cuttlefish


## Summary

## Components
All componenets in the Cuttlefish library such as Motors, Encoders, and Servos are interfaces allowing for the use of Cuttlefish on different platforms. This means that a small amount of code needs to be written to bridge Cuttlefish with the platform SDK. We provide the CuttlefishFTCBridge library to this this which also provides additional functionality. For more info see <a href="/CuttlefishFTCBridge/index.html">CuttlefishFTCBridge</a>. If you wish to use Cuttlefish without the CuttlefishFTCBridge library you will have to write your own implementations for the <a href="/cuttlefish/com.roboctopi.cuttlefish.components/index.html">Cuttlefish componenets interfaces</a>.

***All examples provided will be utilizing the CuttlefishFTCBridge library.***

## Coordinate system
The robot starts at (0,0,0) <br>
Forward is positive Y <br>
Backward is negative Y <br>
Right is positive X <br>
Left is negative X <br>
Clockwise is negative R <br> 
Counter-clockwise is positive R <br> 

## Primary systems
There are four primary Cuttlefish systems:
- <a href="/cuttlefish/com.roboctopi.cuttlefish.controller/-mecanum-controller/index.html">Mecanum Controller</a>
- <a href="/cuttlefish/com.roboctopi.cuttlefish.localizer/-three-encoder-localizer/index.html">Three Encoder Localizer</a>
- <a href="/cuttlefish/com.roboctopi.cuttlefish.controller/-p-t-p-controller/index.html">Point to Point Controller</a>
- <a href="/cuttlefish/com.roboctopi.cuttlefish.queue/-task-queue/index.html">Task Queue</a>

All four of these systems should be initialized in your Initialized opmode

### Mecanum Controller

In order to initialize the mecanum controller you need to get all four of the chassis driver motors and pass them into the constructor
```java
CuttleMotor leftFrontMotor  = ctrlHub.getMotor(3);
CuttleMotor rightFrontMotor = ctrlHub.getMotor(2);
CuttleMotor rightBackMotor  = expHub .getMotor(2);
CuttleMotor leftBackMotor   = expHub .getMotor(3);

MecanumController ctrlr = new MecanumController(rightFrontMotor,rightBackMotor,leftFrontMotor,leftBackMotor);
```
The mecanum controller can be used to control the robot using the setVec function. The set vec function takes a <a href="/cuttlefish/com.roboctopi.cuttlefish.utils/-pose/index.html">Pose</a> object as an argument to describe the direction of motion. The Y value of the pose describes the power in the forward/backward direction, the X value of the pose describes the power in thn side to side direction, and the R value of the pose decribes the rotational power. Here is an example of how robot-centric driver control works using this system:
```java
public void mainLoop()
{
    chassis.setVec(new Pose(gamepad1.left_stick_x,-gamepad1.left_stick_y,gamepad1.right_stick_x));
}
```
Left stick Y is negative because positive Y is downward on the controller.

### Three Encoder Localizer

### Point to Point Controller

### Task Queue
