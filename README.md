# Cuttlefish
Cuttlefish is an FTC oriented library designed to make both the robot programming process, and the resulting code, simpler, faster and better. It contains a variety of features including deadwheel odometry, waypoint based navigation, and queue based task scheduling system. Cuttlefish is designed to be modular and extendable so that you can easily use it to augment rather than replace your own code.
